## Understanding Semantic Versioning

When working on Python projects, understanding semantic versioning is crucial. It helps in managing package versions and indicates the nature of changes in a version number.

Semantic versioning, often referred to as SemVer, follows the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format. This versioning system ensures that developers and users can quickly identify the impact of changes.

## Setting Up the Linux Terminal in VS Code Using Zsh

A powerful development environment is crucial, and setting up your Linux terminal in VS Code using Zsh can enhance your workflow. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Linux terminal.
2. Install Zsh by running the following command if it's not already installed:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install zsh
   ```

3. Install Oh My Zsh by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
   ```

4. Customize your Zsh environment by editing the `.zshrc` file. You can change the ZSH_THEME to your preferred theme.

   ```bash
   ZSH_THEME="bira"
   ```

5. Explore and install various plugins to enhance your development experience. Popular plugins include zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting.

6. Reload Zsh after each change in the configuration.

## Managing Multiple Python Versions with Pyenv

There are situations where you need to work with different Python versions on the same machine. This is where Pyenv comes in handy. Here's how you can manage multiple Python versions using Pyenv:

1. Install Pyenv by running:

   ```bash
   curl https://pyenv.run | bash
   ```

2. Add the required lines to your `.zshrc` file to initialize Pyenv:

   ```bash
   export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
   export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
   eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
   ```

3. Install the necessary build dependencies for Pyenv:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
   libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl \
   libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
   ```

4. Pyenv allows you to switch between Python versions seamlessly, making it a versatile tool for Python development.

## VS Code Extensions for Python Development

Enhance your Python development experience in VS Code with these useful extensions:

1. Markdown All in One
2. Python
3. Pylance
4. Gitlens
5. Pylint
6. Black formatter
7. Flake8
8. Isort (to sort imports)
9. Mypy (for type hinting)
10. Error Lens
11. Darker (for code reformatting)

These extensions can significantly improve your code quality and development productivity.

## Version Control with Git

Version control is fundamental for collaboration and code management. Git is a widely used version control system that allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your codebase. You can use services like GitHub or GitLab to host your repositories.

## Creating Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are essential for isolating Python dependencies and managing project-specific packages. You can create virtual environments using tools like `virtualenv` or `venv`. This practice ensures that your project dependencies do not interfere with system-wide packages.

## Package Building in Python

Packaging your Python code for distribution is a key part of software development. Understanding how to create packages, manage dependencies, and use tools like `setuptools` is crucial for sharing your work with others.
